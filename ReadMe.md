Generative AI Testing Project
Overview
Welcome to the Generative AI Testing Project! This project demonstrates how to test the accuracy of different Large Language Models (LLMs) using Java. It leverages various technologies to provide a robust framework for evaluating LLMs.

Tech Stack
Java: The primary programming language used for development.
Langchain4j: A library used to interface with generative AI models.
Serenity: A testing framework to support behavior-driven development (BDD) and automated testing.
Maven: A build management tool used for dependency management and project build.

Explanation
textToVector(String text):

Uses Luceneâ€™s StandardAnalyzer to tokenize the text and create a term frequency map.
calculateCosineSimilarity(Map<String, Double> vectorA, Map<String, Double> vectorB):

Calculates cosine similarity between two term frequency vectors, ensuring that both vectors have the same dimensionality.
Handling Edge Cases:

Checks for zero norms to avoid division by zero errors.

Objectives
The main objective of this project is to offer insights and tools for assessing the accuracy of LLMs. This includes evaluating their responses against predefined criteria and generating reports on their performance.
